# Algorithm-for-Massive-Data
The main aim of this project is to develop a system to identify frequent itemsets and conducting market basket analysis on a Medal dataset. 
We are focusing mainly on the “full_data.csv” file and we are using text as baskets and words as items. 
There are many different ways to find frequent item sets according to the Market-Basket analysis theory, but in our case 
we are focusing only on two of them: the Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm and the A-Priori algorithm.
