# Algorithm-for-Massive-Data

The main aim of this project is to develop a system to identify frequent itemsets using a Market-Basket analysis on a Medal dataset. 
We are focusing on the “full_data.csv” file and we are treating text as baskets and words as items. 
There are many different ways to find frequent item sets according to the Market-Basket analysis theory, but in this paper I decided to focus on just two of them: the Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm and the A-Priori algorithm. 
With this paper I tried to report the main differences and similarities among these two functions, and therefore also their weakness and strength.
